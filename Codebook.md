## Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in _AverageDataset.txt_ file.    
For each row, the following columns are provided:

###Row identifiers
_The file contains only one row for each pair of values (subject/activity)._  

- subject: the subject Id.  
- activity: the  activity name:
 - WALKING: subject was walking during the test.  
 - WALKING UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase during the test.  
 - WALKING DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase during the test.  
 - SITTING: subject was sitting during the test.  
 - STANDING: subject was standing during the test.  
 - LAYING: subject was laying down during the test.  

###Measures columns
_Prefixes:_  
_Mean_: refers as a mean of all observations for the same subject/activity from the source file.  
_Time/Freq_: refers as a "Time domain" measure or "Frequency domain" measure.
