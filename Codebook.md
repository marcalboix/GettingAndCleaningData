# Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in AverageDataset.txt

For each row, the following columns are provided:

###Row identifiers
The file contains only one row for each pair of values (subject/activity).
- subject: the subject Id.
- activity: the  activity name:
 - WALKING: subject was walking during the test
 - WALKING UPSTAIRS: subject was walking up a staircase during the test
 - WALKING DOWNSTAIRS: subject was walking down a staircase during the test
 - SITTING: subject was sitting during the test
 - STANDING: subject was standing during the test
 - LAYING: subject was laying down during the test

###Measures columns
Mean: refers as a mean of all obs. for the same subject/activity from the source file.
Time/Freq: refers as a "Time domain" measure or "Frequency domain" measure.
